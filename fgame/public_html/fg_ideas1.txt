Basic architecture of Fleet Game (fgame)

fgame - main game object
Has:
* fgOption list (options not dependent on rulesets, like player name?)
* fgDisplay (?)
* fgMap
* fgRuleset (list?)  (possibly contain rule code in here?)
* fgRuleOption list
* load/save functions
* fgPlayer list
* main game loop
Ideas:
** Possibly split more abstract into game state, with loop/main display
   done with something like WebFGame

fgMap - main map
Has:
* fgSystem list
* fgFleet list
* fgSystemLinks (links in warp-linked map)
* code to display main map

fgSystem - star system
Has:
* ID# for reference
* Name of system
* system improvements
* Order list (to be done during the turn)
* Drawing method for map
** Possible drawing 
Refers to:
* ID#s of local fleets
* (possibly) other close or linked systems
* fgPlayer owner

fgFleet
Has:
* ID# for reference
* Strength (initial trivial)



===========
Misc ideas/text:

* For easier debugging don't reuse any ID#s
* Orders could have types, then be sorted for phases

Phase order:
* Produce
* Move
* Diplomacy (later)
* Battle
* Ownership changes (done after all battles)

Question: what to do if 3 (or more) at-war fleets meet in one place?
* Random pair, then winner fights others?
* All arrivals fight first, then against planet?
* micro-sim 3-way battle?
* Weaker fleets temp-join against strongest?
* Should be ruleset defined.

Concepts in (space) 4X games

* Map
** Travel methods
*** Links
*** blockages (with non-linked)
*** Speed

* Diplomacy
* Trade (within self or other empire)
* Player traits
* Races (mostly trait collections or limits)
* AI Personality (possibly player too?)
** Trustworthy, expansionist, militaristic, peaceful
* Espionage
* Exploration
* Governments
* Random Events
** Random opportunities (with choices)

* Locations/Star systems
** often Planets
** could have hierarchy (region/constellation/star/planet-moons/nation/etc)

* Economy
* Resources
** Credits as catch-all, often global
** Food (usually local)
** Power (electrical): local-only 

* Population
** Happiness
** Security

* Fleets
* Ship types
** Ship designer

* Research
