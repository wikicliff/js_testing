Misc ideas for colony1:

* Very raw prototype to start with.
* Possibly just rewrite HTML?
* Game log window (separate from debug)

-------
New idea: rather than DF-like, make a 4X-like kind of kit.

* Less competition freely available
* Other 4X focus on making best single game rather than kit.

Idea: make something with scope expandable to a game like Aurora, but with
      modern HTML5 interface.

Possibly eventually have mega-simulation running from DF-scale to
  galactic empire (and beyond! :).

--------
Flexible time-step simulations

* Possibly at higher speeds start abstracting out or randomly checking
  lower-level sims.
** ex: if 0.1% chance of a failure per task attempt, maybe do batches of 20
   each with a 2% chance of a fail.
*** For more fidelity, if 2% chance taken, then do the 20 individual sims?
**** With one or more randomly chosen fails within those 20.
**** Hard to match all percentages of original non-abstracted.
