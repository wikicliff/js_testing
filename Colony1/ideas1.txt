Misc ideas for colony1:

* Very raw prototype to start with.
* Possibly just rewrite HTML?
* Game log window (separate from debug)

-------
New idea: rather than DF-like, make a 4X-like kind of kit.

* Less competition freely available
* Other 4X focus on making best single game rather than kit.

Idea: make something with scope expandable to a game like Aurora, but with
      modern HTML5 interface.

Possibly eventually have mega-simulation running from DF-scale to
  galactic empire (and beyond! :).
